# HSR Optimizer - CV Leaderboard Fork

This repository is a feature fork of [fribbels/hsr-optimizer](https://github.com/fribbels/hsr-optimizer), focused on adding CV leaderboard tooling while keeping the upstream experience intact. Refer to the upstream project for full documentation, issue tracking, and release notes.

## Features

- Character optimizer: https://fribbels.github.io/hsr-optimizer/
- Relic scorer: https://fribbels.github.io/hsr-optimizer/#showcase
- CV leaderboard: https://fribbels.github.io/hsr-optimizer/#leaderboard

## CV Leaderboard

Compare your builds with the community using the global Crit Value leaderboard. Filter by character and region to discover the top entries and light cone pairings.

**How to share your build**
1. Open the `Showcase` tab and load a 9-digit showcase ID.
2. Once the profile finishes loading, characters with valid Crit Rate and Crit DMG stats upload automatically.
3. Open the `Leaderboard` tab to view your builds alongside the community rankings.
